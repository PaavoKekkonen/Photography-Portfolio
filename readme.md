# Photography Portfolio
 A photography portfolio website I designed and created for myself.

 ## How it works
 The website consists of multiple HTML files, which are then styled by a single css file located in the styles folder with some additional functionality added by a few js files located in the scripts folder. As a photography portfolio, the website contains a lot of images that are contained in the images folder.

 ## Live website
 The website is currently live [here](https://users.aalto.fi/~kekkonp1/portfolio/).
